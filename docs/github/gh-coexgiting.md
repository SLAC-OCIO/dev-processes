Gitiquette - CoExGiting
==============

> Collaboration is an agreement between individuals to sublimate their ego's and focus on an end goal.

##A few simple rules

1. Don't work in master, branch or fork.
2. Don't issue PR's before pulling previous changes in the Master branch. It causes confusion and most of the time it won't merge.
3. Use a gitignore file, don't push file system cruft or settings with passwords. Github is *almost* forever.
